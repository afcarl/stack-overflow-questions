# Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(tidytext)
library(scales)

sessionInfo()

# https://brandcolors.net/b/stackoverflow
stack_overflow_color <- "#f48024"
```

```{r}
theme_set(theme_minimal(base_size=9, base_family="Source Sans Pro") +
            theme(plot.title = element_text(size=8, family="Source Sans Pro Bold", margin=margin(t = -0.1, b = 0, unit='cm')),
                  axis.title.x = element_text(size=8),
                  axis.title.y = element_text(size=8),
                  plot.subtitle = element_text(family="Source Sans Pro Semibold", color="#969696", size=6),
                  plot.caption = element_text(size=6, color="#969696"),
                  #axis.text.x = element_text(size = 5),
                  legend.text = element_text(size = 6),
                  legend.key.width = unit(0.25, unit='cm')))
```


```{r}
file_path <- "~/Downloads/stack-overflow-2017.csv"

df <- read_csv(file_path)

df %>% head()
```

Add columns relevant to the timing when the post was made. The raw data is in `UTC`, so it must be converted to Eastern.

```{r}
df <- df %>% mutate(
        creation_date = with_tz(creation_date, "America/New_York"),
        hour_posted = hour(creation_date),
        weekday_posted = wday(creation_date, label=T, abbr=F),
        week_posted = floor_date(creation_date, '1 week'),
        month_posted = floor_date(creation_date, '1 month')
)
```

# Overview

For all questions asked:

## Weekly

```{r}
plot <- ggplot(df, aes(x=week_posted, y=..count..)) +
          geom_bar(fill = stack_overflow_color, alpha=0.75) +
          scale_x_datetime(date_breaks='2 months', date_labels='%b') +
          scale_y_continuous(labels=comma) +
          labs(title='New Stack Overflow Questions in 2017',
               x='Week Question was Posted',
               y='# of Questions Posted')

ggsave('weekly_count.png', plot, width=4, height=3)
```
